This portfolio highlights my work throughout this semester. From beginning to learn my way around R to being able to create full-fledged R Markdown assignments with multiple visualizations, my journey through this learning process is documented here.

It's been a fantastic opportunity to learn about coding in R, and I'm quite proud of the work that I was able to accomplish during my time in this class!
